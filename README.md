Description
===========

This is the readme file. This will be done in Markdown. It's not rocket science or a big deal, but it's here if we want to do something with it.

### Example

For the `Game.java` file, in the `com.krutten.tilegame` package.

    //tick
    public void tick() {
        //done 60 times per second
    }

    //render
    public void render() {
        //done as fast as the computer will allow
    }

Requirements
============

IntelliJ and Github Account

## Platform

* Windows
* Mac
* Linux

Any issues in with the installation of an IDE, let me know. I think I can get it to work just fine with Eclipse or Netbeans, but I'm not a java pro by any means. That being said, I kind of hate jGrasp. You can use it. It might be funky to set up, but I can do what I can to help.
